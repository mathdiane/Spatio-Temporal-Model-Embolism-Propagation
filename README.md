## Data 

To download all the image data, processed data, and code for the survival models used in the paper, please go to Zenodo Dataset (Link).

## Usage

To get started, download `drygla.zip` from Zenodo Dataset (Link) and run the code (`main.R`) on the survival data (`real_data.RData`) to fit a spatial survival model for *drygla4_leaf*.

To fit survival models for all the data, download all the zip files from Zenodo Dataset (Link), uncomment the for-loop in `main.R`, and then run the code (`main.R`).
